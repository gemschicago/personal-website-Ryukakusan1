<h3><strong>School Life</strong></h3>
<h5>GEMS, 2020</h5>
</div>
<div>
<p>School this year has certainly been a new experience not only for me, but also for every student in the U.S. But there's something different that my school is doing that is slightly special. The majority of us are actually back into school. Sure, there's a few of my classmates and friends doing online learning due to personal prefrence, but about 75% of us are in person learning. What makes this stick out so much is that we're probably the only school who has the highest amount of in person attendance rate, let alone being able to physically go. </p>

<h4><strong>My Hobbies and Interests </strong></h4>
<p>~I've done fencing for more than a year and done dance for about 8 years. I've been enjoying reading and writing poetry as an artstyle ever since 7th grade. I'm also quite invested in Asian subcultures. I've grown up with japanese animations, more popularily known as anime, as well as kpop. Adding on to that, I'm quite the foodie. I enjoy a various of dishes such as clam chowder, mango tapioca, green onion egg pancake, and many more.</p>
